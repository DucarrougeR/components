# Lens

Lens is Looker's design system.

## Developing Lens

You can run Lens locally to view the documentation, develop, and live-compile to CSS.

### Requirements

- node.js
  - To install with Homebrew: `brew install node`
  - Node version switching is supported with `nvm`
    - To install with Homebrew: `brew install nvm`
- yarn
  - To install with Homebrew: `brew install yarn`

### Running locally:
1. Navigate to project folder
2. `$ yarn install` to install Node dependencies
3. `$ yarn start` to run the local servers
4. Open browser to http://localhost:8080/

### Building for production:
_**(Once you've made local changes and are ready to deploy them to Lens in production)**_

1. Commit all your local changes using good, descriptive commit messages
2. `$ yarn run build` runs webpack to build the `/dist` directory
3. Create a _separate_ "build" commit that only includes the updated `/dist` files
4. Submit a Pull Request to be reviewed and merged into master

To test your production build:
1. Make sure your local (git ignored!) `.env` file contains the correct credentials (ask ops-requests if you need help getting them)
2. `$ yarn run production` runs the production server
3. Open browser to http://localhost:3000/ to make sure it works as expected! You should be prompted to log in via Google with your looker email.

### Re-deploying to lens.dev.looker.com:
_**(Only when your PR is merged to master and you've tested the build with the steps above)**_

1. Send a request to ops-requests@looker.com for Lens to be re-deployed (it will be synced with the latest build commit on master)
2. Once http://lens.dev.looker.com/status reflects your latest build commit, http://lens.dev.looker.com should be up to date with your latest changes!
