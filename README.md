# Lens: Looker Design System
Lens is an internal design system made for Looker.

## Running Docs Locally (Right now)
The Lens docs are built with Jekyll. This means you'll need to get Jekyll up and running in order to view and edit the docs on your own machine. Jekyll will handle rendering the pages and compiling Sass, so no need to run `sass --watch` or anything like that.

To get Jekyll running follow these steps:

* Open Terminal and navigate to where your project-Lens site folder lives
* Run `bundle install`
* After that finishes, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
* Go to your browser and load up `localhost:4000/project-Lens/`

Way to go, nerd. You should be up and running now!
