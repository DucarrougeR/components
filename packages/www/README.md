We use Gatsby to power our living style guide.

**NOTE** You need to build the component packages locally before the style guide will successfully build. To do so run:

- `yarn` - install dependencies
- `yarn build` - builds source, builds Typescript definitions, runs complete lint suite.

## Useful commands

- `yarn workspace www develop` - Start local gatsby development server (http://localhost:8000)
