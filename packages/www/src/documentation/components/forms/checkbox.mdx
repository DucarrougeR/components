The `<Checkbox />` component renders a single checkbox element on the page, with no accompanying label. It is generally used to construct higher-order components like the `<FieldCheckbox />`. If you are building a form, you probably want to use `<FieldCheckbox />` instead as it provides label support.

```jsx
<Checkbox />
```

## Branded Property

The `branded` property turns the background to the theme's primary color when checked.

```jsx
<Checkbox branded />
```

## Name and ID

A name and ID can be specified in the `<Checkbox />` component. Names are important if the checkbox is used in the context of a form, in which case a name is required for the value of the checkbox to be captured.

```jsx
<Checkbox name="someName" id="someId" />
```

## Checked Property

The `<Checkbox />` component accepts the `checked` property, which sets the checkbox as either selected or not.

```jsx
<Checkbox checked={true} onChange={() => {}} readOnly />
<Checkbox checked={false} onChange={() => {}} readOnly />
```

## Disabled Property

Use the disable property to gray out the checkbox, making it unclickable.

```jsx
<Checkbox disabled />
<Checkbox disabled checked onChange={() => {}} />
```

## Accessibility

### Best Practices

- Individual checkboxes must have an onscreen `<Label>`
- Groups of checkboxes must have group label, using the `<Fieldset>` and `<legend>` tags.
- See related [ARIA attributes](#related-aria-attributes)

### Markup Expectations

- **Always** include an unique id on the checkbox element so it can be referenced by a label `<Checkbox id="agree">`

### Labeling Expectations

- Use clear and descriptive labels that avoid ambiguity.
- **Always** include a `<Label>` with a `for` property that matches the checkbox `id`.

```jsx
<Label htmlFor="email-optin">
  <Checkbox id="email-optin" value="confirm" />
  Subscribe to our email list
</Label>
```

- Groups of checkboxes **must be** wrapped in a `<fieldset>` and have `<legend>` that describes the group

```jsx
<Fieldset legend="Pick your favorite emojis">
  <Checkbox id="pizza" name="emoji" value="pizza" />
  <Label htmlFor="pizza">üçï</Label>
  <Checkbox id="avocado" name="emoji" value="avocado" />
  <Label htmlFor="avocado">ü•ë</Label>
  <Checkbox id="grapes" name="emoji" value="grapes" />
  <Label htmlFor="grapes">üçá</Label>
</Fieldset>
```

## Focus Expectations

- checkboxes with `:focus` should have an outline and/or a visible change to show it has focus.
- If the checkbox with `:focus` has an error, the error should be read by a screen reader

## Keyboard Expectations

- If checkbox has focus the `SPACE` key should toggle the state.
- If checkbox has focus the `Enter` key should submit the form.
- If checkbox has focus, `TAB` and `SHIFT+TAB` should move focus to next focusable element.

## Related Aria Attributes

### aria-describedby

Use this to provide a detailed descriptions of a field that contains errors.

```jsx
<Label htmlFor="approve">Approve Changes</Label>
<Checkbox id="approve" aria-describedby="confirm-error-message" />
<p id="confirm-error-message">Confirm you approve these changes</p>
```

This would announce "Approve, unchecked checkbox. Confirm you approve these changes"
