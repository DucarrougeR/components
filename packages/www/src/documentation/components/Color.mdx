# Color Wheel

The `<ColorWheel/>` renders an HSV based color wheel. The wheel can be rendered at any needed size by providing a `size` property.
The color wheel defaults to selecting a highly saturated and bright red hue.

[This website has a nice treatment on the HSV color space,](http://learn.leighcotnoir.com/artspeak/elements-color/hue-value-saturation/)
One takeaway is that HSV color space can be thought of as a cylinder, where each slice of the cylinder is showing a circle at a particular
value between 0 and 1. `Hue` can be thought of as the angle from the center of the circle can take on values between 0 and 360.
`Saturation` is the distance from the center on a unit circle.

## Hue, saturation, and value properties

The `<ColorWheel />` component accepts `hue`, `saturation`, and `value`. Setting the `value` will change the brightness of the
of the color wheel itself, while changing the `hue` and `saturation` will indicate what color has been selected on the color wheel.

<Playground>
  <ColorWheel size={200} hue={140} saturation={0.5} value={1} />
</Playground>

## onColorChanged property

Use this to provide a callback to know when a new (hue, saturation) tuple has been clicked. Note that the brightness will never change for a given
slice of a color wheel, and should be handled outside the color wheel component.

# Color Field Picker

<ComponentDetail
  of="ColorFieldPicker"
  figmaURL="file/h7RYPRCSlz3k8fLzEMRSzy/Color-Wheel?node-id=83%3A3"
  status="experimental"
/>

This component is composed of a `FieldText` and a `ColorWheel` that appears in a `RichToolTip` upon hover above its color swatch.

<Playground>
  <ColorFieldPicker />
</Playground>

Like the `FieldText` component, `value` and `onChange` are passed in as props creating an interactive `ColorFieldPicker`.
