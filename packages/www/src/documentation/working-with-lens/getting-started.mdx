# Getting Started

Lens is currently published to Nexus, Looker's private package server. [First, ensure your project is setup to pull NPM packages from Nexus.](https://github.com/looker/helltool/blob/master/docs/dev/npm_nexus_packages.md#configuring-nexus-for-npm-package-consumption)

Next, add Lens to your project.

```bash
yarn add @looker/components @looker/design-tokens @looker/icon
```

Import some components from Lens:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider, theme } from '@looker/components'

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <Card>{Source here...}</Card>
</ThemeProvider>
```

Which renders the following:

<Playground>
  <Card raised>
    <CardContent>
      <Heading fontWeight="semiBold" textTransform="caps">
        Welcome to Lens
      </Heading>
      <Text>Looker's component library</Text>
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
</Playground>

Try editing the code above, you should see the changes appear live.

These live editing blocks are found throughout lens.looker.com, providing a space for rapid experimentation with components.

## Extending Lens

### Composition

Lens (and React) rely heavily on the concept of composition, where smaller components can be composed to create higher-order behavior. In the `SpaceCard` example above the Lens `Card`, `CardContent` and `Heading` are composed to define a what it means to display a Space object in Card format.

### Extending behavior

In rare cases Lens may not support the exact presentation or behavior necessary. Through composition and styling, most components can be extended and customized. Here's an example of a new LoggerButton that logs every click:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import {
  Button as BaseButton,
  ButtonProps as BaseButtonProps,
} from '@looker/components'

const logHandler = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLElement>) => {
  logger(event.target.value)
}

export const LoggerButton: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ onClick, ...props }) => {
  let clickHandler = logHandler
  if (onClick !== undefined) {
    clickHandler = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLElement>) => {
      logHandler(event)
      if (onClick) onClick(event)
    }
  }

  return (
    <Button onClick={clickHandler} {...props}>
      {props.children}
    </Button>
  )
}
```

### Extending styling

Styling can also be extended, but care is needed to ensure you do not violate Looker's design principles.

```jsx
import { Button } from '@looker/components'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const CircularButton = styled(Button)`
  border-radius: 4rem;
`

<CircularButton>+</CircularButton>
```

#### Theme

To help stay withing Looker's design principles, [Lens publishes a theme object](https://github.com/looker/lens/blob/master/src/style/theme.ts), along with libraries, like Styled Components and styled-system, to easily access the theme object within components. For example, when styling components using Lens' `styled` function, the theme object becomes part of a component's props:

```jsx static
import { Button } from '@looker/components'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const DangerButton = styled(Button)`
  background-color: ${props => props.theme.colors.semanticColors.danger.main};
`
```

```jsx
import { Heading } from '@looker/components'

interface PersonTitleProps {
  person: Person;
}

const BasePersonTitle = ({ props: PersonTitleProps }) => {
  return (
    <Heading as="h2">
      {props.person.name} - {props.person.title}
    </Heading>
  )
}

const PersonTitle =
  styled <
  PersonTitleProps >
  BasePersonTitle`
  background-color: ${props =>
    props.theme.colors.semanticColors.primary.lighter};
  font-size: ${props => props.theme.fontSizes[5]};
  padding: ${props => props.spacing.large};
`
```

Using the Theme ensures your styling stays within the Looker design guidelines and will align in all Looker apps.
