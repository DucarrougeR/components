Breakpoints give hooks for components and layouts to adapt and change in relation to the window size of the users device.

Lens uses a mobile first approach to breakpoints, that means we use the `min-width` property for our media queries. This technique is used for applying basic layout styles first and then using breakpoints to adjust for wider screens.

### Available Breakpoints

<BreakpointTable />

There are a few ways to use the breakpoints, for simpler responsive behaviors you can use them as an array of values inline like

<Playground>
  <Box bg={['green', 'blue', 'red', 'purple']} p="xxlarge" color="white">
    My background changes color as you resize the window
  </Box>
</Playground>

Another option if you are writing more complex responsive behaviors you can access the breakpoints from the theme and use them a styled block

```typescript
const ResponsiveBox = styled(Box)`
  background: green;

// make the background red at breakpoint[0](480px)
@media (min-width \${props => props.theme.breakpoints[0]}) {
background: red;
}

// make the background red at breakpoint[1](768x)
@media (min-width \${props => props.theme.breakpoints[1]}) {
background: blue;
}
`
```
