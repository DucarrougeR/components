# Design Contribution

There are a few steps to follow to ensure any new contributions will work within the current Lens ecosystem. Each step of the contribution process will be described in detail below, but here is a quick overview of the process:

1. Open new [JIRA issue](https://looker.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=148&view=planning.nodetail) with description of the contribution and a link to any related Figma files
2. A small review process
3. Add to team library and socialize

## Some example contributions could be:

- Adding a new component or style
- Update a current component or style
- Identify potential new components to be built based on your teams work.

## Step 1: Open an Issue

The Lens team uses JIRA to track all our work, any new contribution needs to have an issue assigned to it so we can track the work.

### How do I open an issue?:

TODO - Add copy & paste template for JIRA design ticket.

### What to expect from this step:

The Lens team will respond as soon as possible or within 24-48 hours to set up a review and answer any questions you have.

## Step 2: Review and Revise

The review step is to make sure any new components or styles will work well and predictably for the design team and in engineering hand-off.

### Some items that are subject to review are:

- Naming
- File structure
- Functionality inside Figma
- Accessibility and localization considerations
- Specs and documentation

While not all of these items are needed for each review, its good to know what questions maybe be asked in a review.

### What to expect from this step:

The Lens team will work together with you to ensure your new contribution will work in the expected ways. This could be a training session or a list of changes needed to ensure the new component or style is Lens ready.

## Step 3: Publish & Socialize

Congrats! Your component or style has passed review and is ready to share with the team and we want everyone to know about it!

### After your component passes review you should:

- Publish your component to the team asset library in Figma
- Share your new component in the [Lens](https://looker.slack.com/messages/C9NHFLY0G) slack channel to let everyone know its ready to use
- Close the issue you originally opened at the beginning of this process

### What to expect from this step:

A high-five ðŸ™Œ from the Lens team and the admiration from your coworkers!
