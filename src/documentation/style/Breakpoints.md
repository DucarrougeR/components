Breakpoints give hooks for components and layouts to adapt and change in relation to the window size of the users device.

Lens uses a mobile first approach to breakpoints, that means we use the `min-width` property for our media queries. This technique is used for applying basic layout styles first and then using breakpoints to adjust for wider screens.

### Available Breakpoints

const BreakpointOptionsRender = require('../../../styleguide_components/BreakpointTable').BreakpointOptionsRender;
