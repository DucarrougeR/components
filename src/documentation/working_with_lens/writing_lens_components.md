Lens is built using the following language and libraries:

* [Typescript](typescriptlang.org)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
* [StyledComponents](https://www.styled-components.com/)
* [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system)

You **don't** have to be an expert in all of those technologies to start using Lens today, but it's good to have an understanding about why they were chosen and how they are employed inside Lens.
