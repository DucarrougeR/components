Modals are temporary overlays that offer contextual information or require user input/confirmation. Modals block interactions with the application until being explicitly dismissed. They can be used for lightweight tasks or hosting heavier temporary content.

At its most basic, a Modal is a container for content that should sit above or aside the primary content.

Currently Lens provides two kinds of Modals: [`Dialog`](/#!/Dialog) and [`Drawer`](/#!/Drawer). These components can used on their own or in combination with layout helpers designed expressly for use with modals, specifically: [`ModalHeader`](/#!/ModalHeader), [`ModalContent`](/#!/ModalContent) and [`ModalFooter`](/#!/ModalFooter).

Modals can have a single child. If a child is specified it will automatically be assigned on an `onClick` event that triggers the modal to open.

### Styling

Modals are assembled of two primary pieces a Backdrop (`ModalBackdrop`) and a Surface (`SurfaceBase`).

##### `ModalBackdrop`

This provides the backdrop behind Modal containers. It can be customized via the `backdrop` property. These must be a CSSProperty compatible key / value paired object.

```js
import { Button } from '../Button'
import { DialogManager } from './Dialog/DialogManager'
;<DialogManager
  backdrop={{ background: 'purple', opacity: 1 }}
  content={
    <>
      Stuff and text <a href="#">Focus attention here...</a>
    </>
  }
>
  {onClick => <Button onClick={onClick}>Purple Backdrop</Button>}
</DialogManager>
```

##### `ModalSurface`

`ModalSurface` provides the container that contains the content. It can be customized via the `surfaceStyles` property. These must be a CSSProperty compatible key / value paired object.

```js
import { Button } from '../Button'
import { DialogManager } from './Dialog/DialogManager'
;<DialogManager
  surfaceStyles={{ background: 'pink', borderRadius: 0, padding: '3rem' }}
  content={
    <>
      Stuff and text <a href="#">Focus attention here...</a>
    </>
  }
>
  {onClick => <Button onClick={onClick}>Pink Surface, No Radiae</Button>}
</DialogManager>
```

### ModalContext

`ModalContext` is a [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) that provides access to functionality without requiring the developer to explicitly manage the Modal's state. Currently the context simply provides access to the `closeModal()` method of the Modal.

```js static
const ModalContext = require('./ModalContext').ModalContext

;<ModalContext.Consumer>
  {({ closeModal }) => <Button onClick={closeModal}>Close!</Button>}
</ModalContext.Consumer>
```

#### `withModal`

Provides a React HOC (High Order Component) that will automatically inject any ModalContext properties into a compoonent wrapped with `withModal`.
