      The blue wildebeest, also called the common wildebeest, white-bearded
      wildebeest or brindled gnu, is a large antelope and one of the two species
      of wildebeest. It is placed in the genus Connochaetes and family Bovidae
      and has a close taxonomic relationship with the black wildebeest. The blue
      wildebeest is known to have five subspecies. This broad-shouldered
      antelope has a muscular, front-heavy appearance, with a distinctive robust
      muzzle. Young blue wildebeest are born tawny brown, and begin to take on
      their adult colouration at the age of two months. The adults' hues range
      from a deep slate or bluish gray to light gray or even grayish brown. Both
      sexes possess a pair of large curved horns.
