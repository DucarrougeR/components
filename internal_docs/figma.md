## Figma and Lens

The product design team uses [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for creating and managing our digital assets and prototypes. Figma is a design tool with first class collaboration and team library features that allows us to share and iterate on our Lens assets with the entire design team.

### Getting Started

#### Getting access to Figma

Reach out to someone on the [#design slack channel](https://looker.slack.com/messages/C45GCJ410) and we can get you an invite to the Figma.

Figma is available as a web app but you can also download the [desktop app](https://www.figma.com/downloads/), which performs a bit better for larger files.

#### Learning Figma

The best way to get started with how we use Figma is to reach out to someone on the design team for a walk through of the tool and how we use it. Feel free to ask for a tour in the  [#design slack channel](https://looker.slack.com/messages/C45GCJ410). Everyone on the team would be happy to guide you through our workflow and the ins-and-outs of the tool.

If you are more of a learn-by-doing type of person, Figma has a fantastic set of articles and videos with overviews of product features and how-to guides.
