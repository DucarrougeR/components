# Getting Started With Figma


## Figma and Lens

The product design team uses [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for creating and managing our digital assets and prototypes. Figma is a design tool with first class collaboration and team library features that allows us to share and iterate on our Lens assets with the entire design team.

### Getting access to Figma

Reach out to someone on the [#design slack channel](https://looker.slack.com/messages/C45GCJ410) and we can get you an invite to Figma.

Figma is available as a web app but you can also download the [desktop app](https://www.figma.com/downloads/), which performs a bit better for larger files.

### Learning Figma

The best way to get started with how we use Figma is to reach out to someone on the design team for a walk through of the tool and how we use it. Feel free to ask for a tour in the  [#design slack channel](https://looker.slack.com/messages/C45GCJ410). Anyone on the team would be happy to guide you through our workflow and the ins-and-outs of the tool.

If you are more of a learn-by-doing type of person, Figma has a fantastic set of articles and videos with overviews of product features and how-to guides.

- [Figma Help and Guides](https://help.figma.com/)
    -  Searchable catalog of articles and instructions on how to use every feature in Figma
- [Figma Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQsVmhSa4X-G3lHlUtejzLA)
  - In depth tutorials of features, getting started guides, and example projects
- [Figma Blog](https://blog.figma.com/product/home)
  - Great for quick tips and tricks and new features in the tool

## File Organization and Structure
All of the Lens related Files are in the **Lens Project** which you can find in the list of projects. If you star the project it will be listed in your sidebar so you can access it quickly.

### File Location

### File Cover and Status

Every Lens file has a cover page so that you can quickly scan what type of file it is (e.g.a component, a pattern, a style). The cover page also has a color background which denotes the current state of the file.

### File Organization

Inside each file is a series of pages that maps to our design roadmap workflow. The page list is:
- Title (cover page)
- Components (any local components to the file)
- Define (scoping of file and design work)
- Explore (design explorations and iterations)
- Refine (refinement of explorations )
- Spec (any specifications for work & best practices)
- Launch (Final page, contains finalized work)

#### Files with shared components

One small variation from the file organization structure above is that any file that contains components that are published in the team library will not have a **"Launch"** page. For organizational purposes their "launch" page will match the name of the component or style.

As an example the Icon component's "launch" page will be named **Icons** and that page will contain the published components.

### Leaving Feedback in Figma
Figma allows you to give feedback right in the file you are looking at. You can leave a comment on a screen to start a conversation about any feedback you may have.

Read about using [Figma's commenting system here](https://help.figma.com/editor/1322329-toolbar/comments).

The Lens team also uses Github to track our issues and we welcome you to open an issue if you discover a bug or have feedback related to the design or functionality of a component or style in Figma.

You can open an issue [quickly here with the correct labels](https://github.com/looker/relens/issues/new?title=Design+Feedback&labels=design,figma) to ensure the design team will see it

### Team Library

Our team library is where we share design assets like components and styles. These include things like color swatches, drop shadows, spacing, low level ui elements like buttons and input boxes, all the way to high level components like Cards and Modals.

#### Using the team library

- Figma has some [great documentation on using the team library](https://help.figma.com/editor/team-library).
- [Figma team library tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgRUEyw9xpo) video on youtube.

#### Adding items to the team library

- Search the Figma Lens project for existing components.
- Open or create a new component file by duplicating the Lens [project template](https://www.figma.com/file/aLKZ8fP9X3q0iLj8jknTy9iC/Project-Template) and rename the 'project template copy' to your components title.
- Copy and paste your design and proposal into the exploration page.
- Review with the design team during the weekly design review
- File a [Github issue](https://github.com/looker/relens/issues/new?title=Design+Feedback&labels=design,figma) and notify the [#lens](https://looker.slack.com/messages/C9NHFLY0G) that you that the component is ready for review
