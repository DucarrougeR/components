## How to Use Lens
The provided assets in Lens can be approached in two ways. 

- In [Figma](#figma.md) you can find design components, usage best practices guidelines, & building specifications.

- On [Lens.looker.com](#) you can configure components directly in code.

## Contributing to Lens

### Contribution Model
Lens provides a wide range of content, documentation and resources that make up a design system, from implementation in the codebase to design specification and usage best practices. Because of the many different types of assets, each deliverable has its own specifications to follow. Your contribution may apply to one or all of these categories but here are the steps of the different types of contributions in Lens: 

- Small: correcting existing UI or adjustments to style

- Medium: fixes to guidelines, adding icons, internal references, Tutorials, & Resources 

- Large: a whole new component

### Contributing to Design phases
At the beginning of a project it must go through the design process. All designer must connect with the Lens team to review or propose new components with dependent teams and start a dialog around how to integrate Lens into upcoming and current projects. Follow these steps:

1. Structure & Propose: 
  - Go over the project brief for the upcoming cycle wit the [Lens](https://looker.slack.com/messages/C9NHFLY0G) team
  - Review existing components and assets that could be reused in your designs
  - Discuss semantic naming slots, UI patterns, and best practices

2. Review & Revise: Set up times to review and continue the collaboration process. These reviews can be scheduled as weekly check ins or during open hours available on the design google calendar
  - Walkthrough designs, proposals, and UI components with the Lens team
  - Refine & resolve any questions or concerns

### Large Contribution
You can create new component by composing them on the Lens.looker.com website. Compose the components you need or extend them to create new one.

3. Explain the use cases and define the component elements
4. Include examples of the existing design in the product (if it exists)
5. Provide validation interaction and  error states
6. What are the edge cases
7. Include i18n/long text examples
8. Example of breakpoint reflow behavior on smaller devices
9. Accessibility recommendation (tooltips, keyboard navigation, ...)
10. Any interactions and animated transitions ( gifs or clickable prototypes)

## Filing a Github Issue
Create a Github issue in the Lens repository and include the following:

1. A link to the figma file in question
2. Provide a walkthrough, clickable prototype, or demo of the scenario
3. Include a visual in the the github issue by dragging a screen grab into the message field.
