# How design can contribute a component to Lens
We want to provide an easy way to contribute any reusable components or styles from your work into the teamâ€™s Figma library.

##### Some example contributions could be:

- Adding a new component or style
- Update a current component or style
- Identify potential new components to be built based on your teams work.


#### The Contribution process
There are a few  guidelines and best practices to follow to ensure any new contributions will work within the current Lens ecosystem.
We will describe the contribution process in detail below, but here is a quick overview of the process:


1. Open new [github issue](#https://github.com/looker/lens) with description of the contribution
2. Include a figma link in the 
3. Add to team library and socialize 

#### How to Open an Issue:
The Lens team uses github to track all our work, so for new contributions we require to have an issue assigned to it.

How do I open an issue:
We have a handy template for you to use with all the required information. Just click [here](https://github.com/looker/lens/issues/new) to open an issue.

The [template](https://github.com/looker/lens/blob/872b78b402e362b22ba5f696ef735479a849c9f6/.github/design_issue_template.md) has spots for a description, links to figma files, and any additional notes or briefs to provide extra context.

##### What to expect from this step:
The Lens team will respond within 24 hours or the next business day to set up a review and answer any questions you have. 


#### Review and Revise:
The review step is to make sure any new components or styles will work well and predictably for the design team and in engineering hand-off. 

##### Some items that are subject to review are:

- Naming 
- File structure 
- Functionality inside Figma
- Accessibility and localization considerations
- Specs and documentation

While not all of these items are needed for each review, its good to know what questions maybe be asked in a review.

##### What to expect from this step:
The Lens team will work together with you to ensure your new contribution will work in the expected ways. This could be a training session or a list of changes needed to ensure the new component or style is Lens ready.

#### Step Three: Publish & Socialize

Congrats! Your component or style has passed review and is ready to share with the team and we want everyone to know about it! 

##### After your component passes review you should:

- Publish your component to the team asset library in Figma
- Share your new component in the [Lens](https://looker.slack.com/messages/C9NHFLY0G) slack channel to let everyone know its ready to use
- Close the issue you originally opened at the beginning of this process

##### What to expect from this step:
A high-five ðŸ™Œ from the Lens team and the admiration from your team!
